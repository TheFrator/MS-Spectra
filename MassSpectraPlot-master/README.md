# MassSpectraPlot

Plotting mass spectra with Matplotlib. The project provides a package to plot high-quality mass spectra for scientific papers and thesis.

## Introduction

Script for generating high-quality plots for mass spectra using python and matplotlib.

The package generates pdf or any other image format, which is provides by matplotlib. The scripts can be used for scientific publications with Latex support.

The package provides three different ways to plot and annotate a mass spectrum. Some examples can be found in the [Usage section](#using-the-script).

**Properties**

- All dimensions are defined in Millimeters.
- Import raw files from Bruker
- Automatic annotate a list of peaks from a text file.
- Manually annotate peaks
- Manually annotate distances between peaks

## Installation

The MassSpectraPlot scripts need a Latex compiler for generating the plots. The scripts are tested on Windows using the Miktex package. But it should also work on any other system.

The script is programmed using Python 3 with the additional installed packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

A `requirements.txt` for virtualenv is also available in the repository.

## Generate the examples

The examples can be generated by executing the `MassSpectraPlot.py` script.

## Using the script

The `MassSpectraPlot.py` script contains three different examples for plotting a mass spectrum.

### Exporting the raw data from the mass spectra software

Every plot of a mass spectrum uses a ASCII based file with x/y data as inputs. This file must have the ending `*.xy`. An example of an input file can be found in the [`examples/inputs` folder][githubexamples]. The x and y values are divided by a space character.

For example the input data for the spectrum can be exported from Bruker Daltonics DataAnalysis. Using `File -> Export -> Mass Spectrum -> Save as simple x-y ASCII File (*.xy)` in the software to generate the appropriate file.

### Generating the peak label list

The automatic annotation of peaks, described in the next section, uses an additional input file. This file must have the same filename as the corresponding xy-file. The ending of the filename is `*.txt`. E.g., `substance1.txt` contains the peak labels for the spectra in `substance1.xy`.

This file is a comma-separated file with two colons. The first value is the x-value of the peak to be annotated and the second colon contains the label for the peak.

An example of this file can be found in [`examples/inputs` folder][githubexamples].

### Automatic annotate the peaks

An example for automic generation of the labels is shown in method `generate_massspectra_plot_automatic_labels(input_filename, output_filename)`.

The function will read the raw values and the label values from the input files. After that the function will generate all labels with a definated minimum distance (`delta_x_text_labels_mm`) between the labels.

### Manually annotate peaks

A peak can be annotated with the function `annotate_point`. Therefore the x value of the point and the horizontal position of the label have to be given. By using the `raw_values` dataframe the function searches the peak next to the given `x_value` automatically.

The method `generate_massspectra_plot_distance_peak_manual_annotation(input_filename, output_filename)` shows the usage of the explained function.

### Manually annotate distances between peaks

A distance between two peaks can be plotted by using the function `annotate_distance`.

An example is shown in the function `generate_massspectra_plot_distance_peak_manual_annotation(input_filename, output_filename)`.

### Comparing two individual plots

The function `generate_massspectra_two_plot_manual_annotation(input_filename1, input_filename2, output_filename)` plots two graphs vertically.

### Customize the plots

The margins and dimensions of the plots are given in millimeters and can be easily customized.
